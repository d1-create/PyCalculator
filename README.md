# PyCalculator
A simple python calculator which uses the CLI
# About this
I did this project after my longer main one that took around 3 days to make, Pycoinflipper, it is more useful for stastistics and probablitity and is much more advanced than this,which I made in 2 hours.
# Why so short?
Although I could try to make a GUI app, it would be extremely hard. This is why I have made a good CLI project (Pycoinflipper) and am aiming in the future to have a better GUI and easy-to-use interface that is simple yet intuitive. I still have some time for this but I am still exploring better performance options such as C++ because I want to make something more powerful, though in a few years I may turn back to see how I've developed over time since now!
